The Institute for Defense Analyses’ approach emphasized combining existing climate models with established military doctrine. We also focused on two specific areas of interest: off-road mobility and Alaskan wildfires. In terms of off-road mobility, we used the European High North as a case study. Projected changes in summer precipitation patterns and soil moisture result in off-road mobility improvements near the Russian-Finnish border, and deterioration in nearby Norwegian and Swedish regions. Operationally, these trends indicate greater off-road flexibility in border regions, while potential overland logistics support areas experience greater reliance on existing road networks and increased risk of airhead congestion (reduced off-road mobility in the areas near existing airfields). Therefore, combining data collection with summer training exercises that have off-road mobility requirements may yield additional value in preparing for future operating conditions.\nAlaskan wildfire trends may also have operational implications, with research pointing to increases in wildfire frequency and severity. There is also no indication that the wildfire management investments required to reverse trends back to historic levels are forthcoming. As a consequence, research that models resource demand as a function of wildfire intensity, severity, and proximity to DoD equities may be valuable to the DoD training enterprise. We are aware of no research that combines climate projections with wildfire-driven demand for DoD manpower or materiel—demand that could divert resources away from regular operations and training activities and limit access to training ranges as wildfires. Increasing wildfire risks may require greater reliance on virtual and constructive training. To the extent that virtual and constructive methods are realistic to accomplish mission essential tasks and available for military organizations training in the Arctic, this may be a viable adaptation in response to increasing wildfire activity.\nFull paper classified CUI//NOFORN.\n\nHolland, R.

In November 2022, federal agencies began the rulemaking process to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The proposed change would require significant contractors to use existing, non-governmental standards in their GHG disclosures. This paper outlines key terms, standards, and issues associated with GHG accounting and reporting, as well as identified areas for further research. (Paper)\n\nEarle, Caroline R., Amy A. Alrich, R.

The study identifies the principal risks climate change poses to space operations as hazards to installations and infrastructure. The study identifies a high degree of scientific and technical uncertainty that will likely constrain domestic and international climate policy applying to space in the near-term.

IDA’s methodology included examining historical project estimates and outcomes, comparing NNSA policy and practices with those of peer organizations, and performing a root cause analysis of the High Explosive Synthesis, Formulation, and Production project. These examinations yielded a number of high-level findings, which ranged across the entire capital acquisition lifecycle, related to areas of strength and areas in need of improvement. On the basis of these findings, IDA identified actionable planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation process improvements across the project lifecycle. IDA recommends that NNSA reconsider how Critical Decision Zero estimates are used internally, as well as the degree to which these estimates are made visible outside of the agency. Further, IDA recommends that NNSA establish and enforce reliable cost estimation practices across and within each lifecycle phase in order to support more comprehensive, well-documented, and accurate estimates.

We conducted an independent assessment of pandemic-inspired trends outside the Military Health System (MHS) across 11 congressionally mandated focus areas. The IDA team identified 30 potential implications of civilian trends for the MHS through reviewing news reports, academic publications, public policies, and empirical data sources. When viewing all 30 potential implications as a whole, 3 common themes emerged. First, the rapid adoption of telehealth has affected health care far beyond how it is delivered. Second, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has also been a shock to institutions’ needs for data and rapid decision-making. Third, the MHS has a unique combination of global scope and integration. As a consequence, the MHS may be exposed to unique risks, compensate for civilian weaknesses, or benefit from disruptions within the civilian healthcare system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further study of the 30 potential implications, or a more focused and comprehensive analysis of these 3 common themes, may help MHS leadership navigate this period of incredible change and challenge brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFull paper classified Distribution D: Distribution authorized to U.S. Government agencies and their contractors.\n\nHirt, Robert D, et al. “Veterans Affairs Electronic Health Record Modernization Quality Assurance Review.” IDA Paper P-20458, Alexandria, VA, February 1, 2021.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn March 2020, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI) asked the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA), on behalf of the VA Deputy Secretary, to provide the first quality assurance review (QAR) of the Electronic Health Record modernization (EHRM) program. The goals of the QAR were to (1) provide an external, independent technical and managerial assessment, and (2) assess both government and contractor processes related to the VA’s EHRM program. The Deputy Secretary accepted all seven IDA recommendations from the baseline assessment. The level of the recommendations varied from enterprise-level recommendations regarding governance, creating enterprise goals for the program, and stakeholder engagement to program-level recommendations involving schedule and risk management. In this report, the IDA team documents its assessment across five focus areas: Leadership and Governance, Planning and Evaluation, Change Management, Data and Accessibility, and Contract Management.\n\nAdams, Joseph F, et al. “Analysis of a Salary-Based Pay System for the Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation.” IDA Document D-13204, Alexandria, VA, September 1, 2020.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper supports the goal of the Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation (QRMC) of understanding how a compensation system that combines basic pay, housing, and subsistence allowances into a single taxable “salary” would affect Service members’ earnings and behavior. This paper also considers the readiness, cost, and tax-revenue implications of such a system. We undertook three lines of effort. First, we modeled the after-tax income effects of transitioning to a salary system. We found that any salary system that maintains constant Federal Government costs will reduce Service members’ aggregate after-tax income. Second, we used econometric models to estimate the likely responses of Service members to changes in after-tax income. We found no significant effect of state military tax exemptions on retention, suggesting that other factors are more influential than raw compensation changes. Third, we conducted focus groups with 740 Service members in every Service by visiting Active and Reserve Component installations in four states. Service members generally expressed strong skepticism of major restructuring of military compensation systems; they view the current system as imperfect, but “fair enough.” Finally, we discuss other possible mechanisms—short of adopting a salary system—that could improve the efficiency and fairness of the current system.\n\nHuff, Nancy M., Alexander A.

CUI//Distribution E: Distribution authorized to DoD Components only.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nAs the Army National Guard (ARNG) has become increasingly more operational, concern has grown that increasing training requirements could cause retention challenges, particularly in the wake of recommendations from the National Commission on the Future of the Army in 2016 that ARNG units be integrated even more into the operational force structure. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the requirements for a more operational ARNG by answering two sets of questions: (1) What have the training requirements been recently for ARNG units and individual soldiers and to what extent are these training requirements projected to increase in the next five years? (2) What effect does increasing training requirements have on retention? We find that programmed unit training levels are not projected to rise beyond recent historical averages through fiscal year 2023. Using an instrumental variables methodology, we estimate only modest effects of training days on retention. We estimate the largest negative effects for Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) where each additional training day per year reduces one-year retention by an estimated 0.63 percentage points—or about 75 personnel out of 5,978 exiting within one year in response to a two-day increase in average training requirements for all BCT units."

Economica, 88(351), 755–781. https://doi.org/10.1111/ecca.12369\n\n\nAbstract\n\nProviding clean water requires maintenance, as well as the initial connections that are typically measured. Frequently, the water supply fails in the developing world, especially when users do not pay the marginal cost of water. This paper uses the timing of frequent, unexpected water service outages in Lusaka, Zambia to identify the short-term impacts of piped water access on contagious disease, economic activity and time use. We use microdata from the primary water utility in the city on the timing and location of supply complaints to identify outages, matched to extensive administrative data across the city. Conditional on fixed effects for time and water service district within Lusaka, we find that increases in outages are associated with increased incidence of diarrhoeal disease, upper respiratory infections, typhoid fever and measles. We match outages to geolocated microdata on financial transactions from the largest mobile money provider in Zambia, and find that outages cause a reduction in financial transactions. Outages also increase the time that young girls spend at their chores, possibly at the expense of time that they spend doing schoolwork. Imperfect infrastructure appears to burden the poor in ways that go far beyond obvious health consequences."

Manuscript in progress, to be submitted in 2025.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nIn theory, individuals should prefer a choice-based lottery (random serial dictatorship) to a uniform random lottery for allocating private goods. However, data from potential beneficiaries of a Nepalese land allocation program show that almost half of participants prefer uniform random allocation. We observe this fact in both a field laboratory experiment and a randomized high-stakes policy intervention. In the lab-in-the-field game, participants choose between two lottery mechanisms. By randomizing cash prizes and game anonymity, we test a broad range of explanations. We find no evidence for lack of comprehension, risk aversion, social pressure, and altruism as potential explanations. At the same time, we find evidence that participants respond, on the margin, to changes in the expected benefits between mechanisms. In our second experiment, we use an information intervention to influence mechanism preferences outside of a laboratory. Our findings indicate that information on preference heterogeneity can affect individual mechanism preferences."

Bewley et al. American Geophysical Union, December 2024. Presented by co-author Dr. Jennifer L. Bewley.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nChanging environmental conditions create operational risks that may impact the U.S. military’s capacity to engage in combat and fulfill assigned missions and tasks (i.e., readiness). While the Department of Defense (DoD) is aware of general climate trends and their potential to impact military operations and readiness, implementing more climate-informed decisions requires a more precise understanding of how future environmental conditions could impact warfighting platforms or operational outcomes. Explicitly tying projected operational environments to mission success metrics is a challenging, multi-step process that requires many different data sources, astute data-reconciliation, and innovative analytical approaches.\nThis presentation explores lessons learned through a discussion of vignettes that aim to assist DoD decision makers in resilience efforts by tying the operational environment to mission success metrics. Although most of these challenges arise due to the pioneering-nature of this analysis, some of the data challenges discussed may be alleviated with production of DoD guidance materials for climate projections for geographical domains.\nAGU Poster\n\n“Potential Operational, Infrastructure, and Strategic Implications of Changes in Heat and Humidity” with Jennifer L. Bewley, et al. SERDP/ESTCP Symposium, December 2021. Presented by co-author Dr. Jennifer L. Bewley.\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) Resource Conservation and Resiliency program area has supported a broad portfolio of infrastructure-focused research intended to help maximize the number of available training days and mission readiness. This analysis takes the first steps at connecting installation-level climatic risks and the other critical input into mission readiness: our people. Over time, we believe this approach can help further SERDP-ESTCP’s mission by supporting more efficient and integrated identification of investments that yield the largest gains in available training days and readiness. In 2019, the Institute for Defense Analyses began developing an internally funded interdisciplinary climate security capability within its cadre of research personnel. One of the first results of this effort is a demonstration analysis mapping global changes in an estimated Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Index derived from the most recent ensemble of Community Earth System Models to a publicly available dataset of the DoD’s current installation infrastructure. We then estimate the anticipated activity limitations for personnel expected to wear body armor on these installations using common work/rest restriction policies. We find that several global regions, as well as important military training installations, are likely to experience increased WBGT levels that could impose meaningful operational limitations. For commanders seeking to avoid these limitations, innovating new cooling technologies and infrastructure, inventing operational concepts that lower the expected physical strain on body armored servicemembers, reducing operational limitations by removing body armor, or simply accepting operational gaps created by these changes may be their only options.\nSERDP/ESTCP Poster"
